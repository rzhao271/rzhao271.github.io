<p><em>Last modified March 20, 2022.</em></p>

<p>In this article, we refine yet again the definition of 3x3x3-like puzzles (333LPs), and touch upon the value of self-honesty.</p>

<h3 id="a-recap-of-parts-i-and-ii">A recap of parts I and II</h3>

<p>In <a href="./333like-mt.html">part I</a>, we stated</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We define a 3x3x3-like puzzle (333LP) as a twisty puzzle that is “similar enough” to the 3x3x3 and the Megaminx.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For reference, the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=650">Megaminx</a> is a dodecahedral variant of the 3x3x3.</p>

<p>We then described what “similar enough” meant using a vague set of requirements. In <a href="./333like-part-ii.html">part II</a>, those requirements became the following:</p>

<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>: A 3x3x3-like puzzle (333LP) on an \(n\)-manifold is a twisty puzzle such that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The puzzle is shallow-cut.</li>
  <li>The puzzle is facet-turning and doctrinaire. If the puzzle contains a finite number of facets, then we require that each facet receive a unique colour. Otherwise, the puzzle contains countably infinite facets, and the facets must be coloured using a finite number of colours such that the coloration is periodic, with no two adjacent facets sharing the same colour, and such that the puzzle is not “limited in size”.</li>
  <li>There is exactly one 1-coloured piece per facet.</li>
  <li>The puzzle can be solved using Roice’s method. The puzzle does not have corners (\((n+1)\)-coloured pieces) with fixed permutations relative to each other.</li>
  <li>Let \(P\) represent the polytope, tiling, or honeycomb that admits the 333LP. Then, the vertex figure of \(P\) is a (potentially irregular) \(n\)-simplex, and \(P\) itself is vertex-transitive and convex.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="whats-wrong-with-the-definition-above">What’s wrong with the definition above?</h3>

<p>Firstly, the definition above unnecessarily restricts shape modifications or sticker modifications from being 333LPs. Therefore, by the definition above, the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1078">Ultimate Cube</a> would not be a 333LP, even though one can solve it just like a regular 3x3x3.</p>

<p>Definition 1 also restricts the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=8368">Kite Trap</a> from being a 333LP, even though it actually solves quite well using Roice’s method, which in this case specifically means an edges-first corners-second method. The restriction occurs because the Kite Trap is a <a href="https://www.twistypuzzles.com/articles/other-twistypuzzlesthatjumble/">jumbling puzzle</a>, and because jumbling puzzles are non-doctrinaire by definition, they fail requirement 2 of the definition.
Note that I only found out about the Kite Trap puzzle last December (2021), whereas part II was written in 2020.</p>

<h3 id="refining-the-requirements-for-a-333lp">Refining the requirements for a 333LP</h3>

<p>What I wanted all along was a label for puzzles that were like a 3x3x3 that can also be solved edges-first. But, knowing that my intent was to label puzzles with similar solutions, I could have stated the requirements more directly as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Definition 2</strong>: A three-dimensional 3x3x3-like puzzle (333LP) is a twisty puzzle that either satisfies the following conditions, or is a sticker or shape modification of another twisty puzzle that satisfies the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The twisty puzzle is face-turning and has at most one center per face. The centers must also be fixed.</li>
  <li>The twisty puzzle lends itself to an edges-first corners-second solution.</li>
  <li>The twisty puzzle has exactly one type of edge piece and exactly one type of corner piece.</li>
  <li>All corners of the puzzle must be solvable using [R U R’, D] and/or [[R’, F], D] commutators and/or variants thereof (such as how for the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1752">Latch Cube</a>, one might need to do an R3 instead of an R’, or how for the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1557">Tuttminx</a>, some turns must be double turns).</li>
</ol>

<p>Definition 2 allows puzzles such as the following to be counted as 333LPs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3x3x3</li>
  <li>Megaminx</li>
  <li>2x2x2</li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1078">Ultimate Cube</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=8368">Kite Trap</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Requirement 4 of Definition 2 rejects the following puzzles that would otherwise be counted as 333LPs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3x3x2</li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=547">Halpern-Meier Tetrahedron</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=621">Skewb</a>, which is a shape modification of the Halpern-Meier Tetrahedron</li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=5793">4-Corners Cube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We can call those puzzles quasi-333LPs.</p>

<p>Definition 2 also disallows puzzles such as the following to be counted as 333LPs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4x4x4</li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=1663">Face-Turning Octahedron</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=7377">Hexadecagon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Hexadecagon might seem like a 16-sided Megaminx, but in reality,
it is a jumbling puzzle that contains two edge types and two corner types.
One set of corners and edges solves like the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=7747">LanLan Star Pyraminx</a>, and the other set solves like a 3x3x2, both of which are quasi-333LPs.</p>

<p>Lastly, we can generalize the definitions above to 333LPs in higher dimensions. This process results in a definition that is similar to Definition 1, but is more direct in its intention. It also correctly labels more puzzles as 333LPs, including all puzzles accepted by Definition 2.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 3</strong>: A 3x3x3-like puzzle (333LP) on an \(n\)-manifold, where \(n \ge 2\), is a twisty puzzle that either satisfies the following conditions, or is a sticker or shape modification of another twisty puzzle that satisfies the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The twisty puzzle is facet-turning, with at most one 1-coloured piece per facet. The 1-coloured pieces must also be fixed.</li>
  <li>The twisty puzzle lends itself to a solution where one solves the 2-coloured pieces first, followed by the 3-coloured pieces, and so on, until they end the solve by solving the \((n+1)\)-coloured pieces.</li>
  <li>The twisty puzzle has exactly one type of \(m\)-coloured piece for \(m \in \{2, \ldots, n + 1\}\).</li>
  <li>All \(m\)-coloured pieces for \(m \in \{3, \ldots, n + 1\}\) must be solvable with the nested commutators given in a <a href="./n-comms.html">previous article</a>, or variants thereof.</li>
</ol>

<p>Definition 3 allows more puzzles such as the following to be counted as 333LPs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://superliminal.com/andrey/mc7d/">7-dimensional 3x3x3x3x3x3x3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvZnh7-nslo">Klein bottle Rubik’s cube</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://superliminal.com/andrey/mht633/">Magic Hyperbolic Tile {6,3,3} (12 colours)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Definition 3 disallows puzzles such as the following from being counted as 333LPs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm">MagicCube4D</a> triangular duoprisms</li>
  <li><a href="https://superliminal.com/andrey/mpu/">Magic Puzzle Ultimate</a> cell-turning 24-cell</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, I wanted a term to describe a subset of twisty puzzles, including the 3x3x3 and Megaminx, that I particularly enjoy solving. Defining that term precisely meant I had to be honest with myself, and state what I actually wanted in the first place.</p>
